**CSC 340 - Music Player**

**Summary**

The goal of the Music Player allows users to add and view their favorite songs, artist, theme, or albums in order. Once finished sorting, the user can play the music list. The user can search for a specific song, skip the current, or go back to a previous song from the list.


**Project Guidelines**

We will be using OOP and extend the LinkedList to form a new data structure with inheritance to store music songs as nodes. With our algorithms, we will use merge sort to sort songs by artist, song title and genre.


**Development Plan**

Stage 1:
Setting up the Linked List
Setting up the Song Class

Stage 2:
Implement a Menu and UI

Stage 3:
Implement a Search and Sort

Stage 4: (Extra)
Implement to playing music
